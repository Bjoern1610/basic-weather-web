# Basic Weather

This website was created for the [Mobile Computing and Internet of Things](https://pcs.tm.kit.edu/962_984.php) course at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The weather web application is based on [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/)'s geocoding API and [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)'s weather API to display common weather information.
